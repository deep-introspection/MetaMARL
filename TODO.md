# Visualization feature branch — handoff TODO

This document is the implementation handoff for the visualization/metrics
feature branch.

The target architecture is:

```text
WHAT DATA EXISTS        -> MetricSchema
HOW DATA ACCUMULATES    -> Metric / MetricLogger
WHAT DATA TO SELECT     -> Query
HOW IT IS DISPLAYED     -> Reporter
```

The branch is not complete until W&B reproduces the dev visualizations,
dynamic runtime keys are queryable, ES advanced plots are supported, tests are
in place, and CSV/TensorBoard reporters are complete.

## Status — 2026-08-27 (branch `feature/logging-testing`)

The stack runs end-to-end with W&B (offline in tests) and with the new CSV
reporter (`python -m examples.bilevel_fishery.debug --reporter csv`). Checked
boxes were verified by tests under `tests/metrics`, `tests/reporting`,
`tests/adaptors` and `tests/optimizers`, or by the smoke run.

Decisions taken (details in `docs/MERGE_NOTES.md` on the mechanism branch):

- Backends receive **labeled series** (`core.reporting.query.Series`: label, x,
  y, optional std) instead of `(x, ys)`; the base `Reporter` owns wildcard
  expansion, x/y binding alignment and mean/std grouping. W&B, CSV and
  TensorBoard only render.
- Wildcards (`"*"`) expand at dynamic nodes in sorted key order; with
  `reduce="mean"` the first wildcard is the grouping dimension and the others are
  averaged. Query-level examples: `examples/bilevel_fishery/queries.py`.
- `SeedRolloutSchema.aggregate` (§3.1): **option B** — no schema change,
  aggregation happens at query resolution.
- `ESSchema.generation` (SERIES) and `generation_best` exist; the parameter
  dicts are keyed by `ParameterName`.
- Reporting is optional: no reporter config -> no reporter, no schema -> no
  logging.
- ES scatter colour (§5.4): `Query.color` is a third path resolved and aligned
  by wildcard binding exactly like `x` (`es_parameter_fitness_queries` colours
  by the root `generation` series), rendered as marker colour on W&B.
- Parallel coordinates (§5.5): option A, `ParallelCoordinatesQuery(title,
  dimensions, color)` resolved by the base `Reporter` into a `Table` (first
  wildcard = row entity, last dynamic key after it = axis label), rendered as
  `go.Parcoords` on W&B and as a wide CSV file; TensorBoard skips it.

Still open: episode-level wildcard queries over `by_episode` (§3, §4). Episode
ids are unique per episode while the inner logger accumulates per training
iteration, so `by_episode/*` series have length 1 against an `iter` axis of
length `train_iters`; aligning them needs an episode-to-iteration key (your
call). exact `dev` plot parity (§1, §21 — the `dev` plotting code is already deleted
on this branch, so parity can only be checked against archived W&B runs),
optional-branch presence semantics (§18), serialization boundary test (§19).

# 1. P0 — validate exact dev plot parity

## 1.1 Environment-level plots

The environment reporter is attached to `FisheryMetricSchema` and should
render the environment horizon before the episode logger is destructively
reduced.

Required current queries:

```python
FISHERY_ENV_QUERIES = [
    Query(
        title="Fish biomass",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("fish_norm",),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Next fish biomass",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("fish_norm_next",),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Fish stock",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("fish_stock",),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Next fish stock",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("fish_stock_next",),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Biological growth",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("growth",),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Growth noise",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("growth_noise",),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Attempted harvest",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("H_attempted",),
    ),

        title="Realized harvest",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("H_realized",),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Allowed harvest",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("allowed_harvest",),

        x=("iter",),
        y=("quota_stress",),
    ),

    Query(
        title="Fishing mortality at MSY",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("F_msy",),
    ),
]
```

Current per-agent helper:

```python
def fishery_agent_queries(agent_id: str) -> list[Query]:
    base = ("by_agent", agent_id)

    return [
        Query(
            title=f"Reward — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("reward",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Action — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("action",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Observation — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("observation",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Intrinsic utility — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("intrinsic_utility",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Violation signal — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("violation_signal",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Requested harvest — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("requested_harvest",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Delivered harvest — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("delivered_harvest",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Requested harvest fraction — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("requested_frac",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Quota violation — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("quota_violation",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Quota penalty — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("quota_penalty",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Risk penalty — {agent_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("risk_penalty",),
        ),
    ]
```

### Environment acceptance checks

- [x] `env.logger.peek()` produces a horizon-length x series and aligned y
      series before `reduce()`.
- [x] `env.reporter.report(env.logger.peek())` does not mutate or clear the
      logger.
- [x] After reporting, `env.logger.reduce()` still returns the correct compiled
      episode metrics.
- [ ] Agent query traces match the agent values shown on dev.
- [ ] No environment-specific field silently disappears when the runtime
      `FisheryMetricSchema` subtype is materialized.
- [ ] No `FisheryAgentMetricSchema` field disappears at the deeper `by_agent`
      runtime subtype.

### Data/schema gaps versus old dev environment plotting

The dev environment plotting code referenced some fields not present in the
provided current `FisheryMetricSchema`, including:

- `full_required_harvest`
- `min_demand_frac`
- `max_demand_frac`
- some environment-level `intrinsic_utility` usage
- named observation/info components

For exact parity:

- [ ] Decide whether each missing metric is environment-level or agent-level.
- [ ] Add shared values to `FisheryMetricSchema`.
- [ ] Add agent-specific values to `FisheryAgentMetricSchema`.
- [ ] Add named observation fields if exact old observation plots are required.
- [ ] Add queries only after the schema field exists.

## 1.2 Inner optimizer: raw RLlib rollout plots

Required queries:

```python
RAY_ROLLOUT_QUERIES = [
    Query(
        title="Train reward",
        x=("iter",),
        y=(
            ("train", "rollout", "aggregate", "reward_mean"),
            ("train", "rollout", "aggregate", "reward_min"),
            ("train", "rollout", "aggregate", "reward_max"),
        ),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Train episode length",
        x=("iter",),
        y=(
            ("train", "rollout", "aggregate", "episode_len_mean"),
            ("train", "rollout", "aggregate", "episode_len_min"),
            ("train", "rollout", "aggregate", "episode_len_max"),
        ),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Train episodes",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("train", "rollout", "aggregate", "num_episodes"),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Train episodes lifetime",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("train", "rollout", "aggregate", "num_episodes_lifetime"),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Eval reward",
        x=("iter",),
        y=(
            ("eval", "rollout", "aggregate", "reward_mean"),
            ("eval", "rollout", "aggregate", "reward_min"),
            ("eval", "rollout", "aggregate", "reward_max"),
        ),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Eval episode length",
        x=("iter",),
        y=(
            ("eval", "rollout", "aggregate", "episode_len_mean"),
            ("eval", "rollout", "aggregate", "episode_len_min"),
            ("eval", "rollout", "aggregate", "episode_len_max"),
        ),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Eval episodes",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("eval", "rollout", "aggregate", "num_episodes"),
    ),
]
```

Acceptance:

- [ ] Train reward mean/min/max are numerically equivalent to dev.
- [ ] Eval reward mean/min/max are numerically equivalent to dev.
- [ ] Episode lengths and episode counts are equivalent.
- [ ] x-axis uses the intended RLlib iteration and is monotonic.

## 1.3 Inner optimizer: performance plots

Required queries:

```python
RAY_PERFORMANCE_QUERIES = [
    Query(
        title="Train environment steps",
        x=("iter",),
        y=(
            ("train", "performance", "env_steps_this_iter"),
            ("train", "performance", "env_steps_lifetime"),
        ),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Train agent steps",
        x=("iter",),
        y=(
            ("train", "performance", "agent_steps_this_iter_sum"),
            ("train", "performance", "agent_steps_lifetime_sum"),
        ),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Environment throughput",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("train", "performance", "env_steps_throughput"),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Training timing",
        x=("iter",),
        y=(
            ("train", "performance", "training_iteration_s"),
            ("train", "performance", "training_step_s"),
            ("train", "performance", "sample_s"),
            ("train", "performance", "learner_update_s"),
        ),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Weights sequence number",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("train", "performance", "weights_seq_no"),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Eval environment steps",
        x=("iter",),
        y=(
            ("eval", "performance", "env_steps_this_iter"),
            ("eval", "performance", "env_steps_lifetime"),
        ),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Eval agent steps",
        x=("iter",),
        y=(
            ("eval", "performance", "agent_steps_this_iter_sum"),
            ("eval", "performance", "agent_steps_lifetime_sum"),
        ),
    ),
    Query(
        title="Eval weights sequence number",
        x=("iter",),
        y=("eval", "performance", "weights_seq_no"),
    ),
]
```

Old dev also had timing/throughput fields such as sync-weight time and
learn-throughput depending on the RLlib result version.

- [ ] Compare current `PerformanceSchema` to the exact dev fields.
- [ ] Add missing fields only if exact dev parity requires them.
- [ ] Do not read raw RLlib dictionaries directly from the reporter once the
      schema adaptor owns those mappings.

## 1.4 Inner optimizer: per-policy learner plots

Current helper:

```python
def ray_policy_queries(policy_id: str) -> list[Query]:
    base = ("train", "learner", "by_policy", policy_id)

    return [
        Query(
            title=f"Batch size — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("batch_size",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Total loss — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("total_loss",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Residual variance — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("residual_variance",),
        ),
        Query(

            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("policy_entropy",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Policy entropy coefficient — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("policy_entropy_coeff",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Policy relative entropy — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("policy_relative_entropy",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Entropy pressure — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("entropy_pressure",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Policy KL — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("policy_kl",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Policy KL coefficient — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("policy_kl_coeff",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Value loss — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("value_loss",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Value mean — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("value_mean",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Value target — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("value_target",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Gradient norm — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("gradient_norm",),
        ),
        Query(
            title=f"Gradient noise — {policy_id}",
            x=("iter",),
            y=base + ("gradient_noise",),
        ),
    ]
```

Acceptance:

- [ ] Every policy in `LearnerSchema.by_policy` can be plotted.
- [ ] Policies do not have to be manually hard-coded after wildcard support.
- [ ] `__all_modules__` / aggregate learner entries are handled intentionally:
      either include with a clear label or exclude explicitly.
- [ ] Loss/entropy/KL/gradient values match dev for the same deterministic run.

Old dev learner fields included names such as `kl`, `entropy`, `vf_loss`,
`policy_loss`, `total_loss`, `vf_explained_var`, `grad_gnorm`, `cur_lr`,
and `cur_kl_coeff`.

Current schema uses normalized names such as `policy_kl`, `policy_entropy`,
`value_loss`, and `gradient_norm`.

- [ ] Make a documented mapping table from dev metric names to new schema names.
- [ ] Add genuinely missing metrics if exact parity requires them.
- [ ] Do not duplicate equivalent metrics under two names without a reason.

# 2. P0 — dynamic dictionary key support in Query

Current limitation:

```python
Query(
    ...,
    y=(
        "train",
        "rollout",
        "by_mechanism",
        "0",       # hard-coded
        "by_seed",
        "100",     # hard-coded
        ...
    ),
)
```

Target:

```python
Query(
    ...,
    y=(
        "train",
        "rollout",
        "by_mechanism",
        "*",
        "by_seed",
        "*",
        ...
    ),
)
```

## 2.1 Required wildcard semantics

- [x] `"*"` matches keys only at dynamic dict nodes.
- [x] Static schema fields are not accidentally wildcarded.
- [x] One wildcard expands to one trace per matched runtime key.
- [x] Multiple wildcards retain their bindings.
- [x] Expansion order is deterministic (sort keys or preserve a documented
      insertion order).
- [x] Missing dynamic branches produce a useful error or an empty match
      according to an explicit policy.
- [x] An exact concrete key continues to work unchanged.
- [x] Wildcard expansion does not mutate the schema/MetricLogger.
- [x] Wildcard resolution works on runtime subtype nodes.

## 2.2 x/y binding

This is critical for ES scatter plots.

Given:

```python
x=(
    "by_mechanism",
    "*",
    "by_parameter",
    "fixed_quota",
    "value",
)

y=(
    "by_mechanism",
    "*",
    "fitness",
)
```

the same wildcard binding must be used on both sides:

```text
x m0 <-> y m0
x m1 <-> y m1
x m2 <-> y m2
x m3 <-> y m3
```

Never form a Cartesian product of candidate x values and candidate y values.

Tests must make candidate values obviously distinct so a binding error cannot
pass accidentally.

# 3. P0 — mechanism mean ±std across seeds

Desired user-facing query:

```python
Query(
    title="Train fish biomass by mechanism ±1 std across seeds",
    x=("iter",),
    y=(
        "train",
        "rollout",
        "by_mechanism",
        "*",
        "by_seed",
        "*",
        "by_episode",
        "*",
        "fish_norm",
    ),
    reduce="mean",
    error="std",
)
```

Expected output:

```text
m0 mean + shaded ±1 std
m1 mean + shaded ±1 std
m2 mean + shaded ±1 std
...
```

The implementation must distinguish:

- grouping dimension: mechanism;
- replicate/reduction dimensions: seed and, if needed, episode.

A naïve wildcard implementation that averages every mechanism and every seed
into one line is incorrect.

## 3.1 Resolve the `SeedRolloutSchema.aggregate` question

The requested older-style path was:

```python
(
    "by_mechanism",
    "0",
    "by_seed",
    "100",
    "aggregate",
    "fish_norm",
)
```

But the supplied schema is:

```python
class SeedRolloutSchema(MetricSchema):
    by_episode: dict[EpisodeID, EpisodeRolloutSchema]
```

There is no `aggregate`.

Choose one:

### Option A — add seed aggregate

```python
class SeedRolloutSchema(MetricSchema):
    aggregate: EpisodeRolloutSchema
    by_episode: dict[EpisodeID, EpisodeRolloutSchema] = Field(
        default_factory=dict
    )
```

Then update the Ray adaptor to populate it.

### Option B — no schema change

Keep `by_episode` only and let Query resolution aggregate wildcard-matched
episode leaves.

Acceptance:

- [x] The choice is documented.
- [x] Tests use the final supported path only.
- [x] No tutorial/example advertises a nonexistent `aggregate` field.

# 4. P0 — train-vs-eval shaded mechanism plots

Target query:

```python
Query(
    title="Fish biomass: train vs eval by mechanism ±1 std across seeds",
    x=("iter",),
    y=(
        (
            "train",
            "rollout",
            "by_mechanism",
            "*",
            "by_seed",
            "*",
            "by_episode",
            "*",
            "fish_norm",
        ),
        (
            "eval",
            "rollout",
            "by_mechanism",
            "*",

            "fish_norm",
        ),
    ),
    reduce="mean",
    error="std",
)
```

Dev behavior to reproduce:

- [ ] train and eval appear in the same figure;
- [ ] one mean curve per phase × mechanism;
- [ ] ±1 std shaded band across seeds;
- [ ] mechanism identity is distinguishable;
- [ ] train/eval identity is distinguishable;
- [ ] deterministic legend order;
- [ ] horizon version uses environment step;
- [ ] over-training version uses RLlib training iteration;
- [ ] no W&B-specific grouping logic is required in the optimizer.

Required target queries for the primary fishery metrics:

```python
TARGET_TRAIN_EVAL_QUERIES = [
    Query(

            ),
        ),
        reduce="mean",
        error="std",
    ),
]
```

Extend the same pattern to the remaining fishery environment fields only when
they are useful and present in the schema.

# 5. P0 — ES exact dev plot parity

The old dev ES visualization had one accumulated history row per evaluated
candidate:

```text
generation
mechanism_idx
fitness
sigma
parameter_0
parameter_1
...
```

It produced:

1. fitness over outer generations;
2. one cumulative fitness-vs-parameter scatter per optimized parameter;
3. cumulative parallel coordinates;
4. scalar series for sigma;
5. search mean per parameter;
6. global-best fitness;
7. global-best candidate parameter values;
8. generation-best parameter values;
9. all-generations table.

The new logger should remain the source of truth; do not reintroduce a separate
global `_ES_HISTORY_TABLES` history cache.

---

## 5.1 ES schema verification

The supplied `ESSchema` includes:

- `sigma`
- `population_size`
- `fitness_mean`
- `fitness_best`
- `best_mechanism_idx`
- `best_fitness_global`
- `by_mechanism`
- `search_mean`
- `global_best`
- `inner`

### Required checks

- [x] `generation` is explicitly present and is `ReduceProtocol.SERIES`, or the
      entire implementation consistently uses inherited `iter`.
- [x] The optimizer and Query use the same x field.
- [x] Add `generation_best` for exact dev parity.
- [x] Consider renaming the type alias used for `search_mean` and
      `global_best` keys from `MechanismID` to `ParameterName`; those dict keys
      are parameter names, not mechanism IDs.

Recommended additions if not already present:

```python
ParameterName: TypeAlias = str

class ESSchema(MetricSchema):
    generation: Optional[int] = Field(
        default=None,
        json_schema_extra={"reduce": ReduceProtocol.SERIES},
    )

    generation_best: dict[ParameterName, ESParameterSchema] = Field(
        default_factory=dict
    )
```

Populate:

```python
generation_best={
    parameter_name: ESParameterSchema(
        value=float(population[best_idx, parameter_idx])
    )
    for parameter_idx, parameter_name in enumerate(parameter_names)
}
```

---

## 5.2 ES fitness-over-generations queries

Fishery acceptance fixture:

```python
ES_CANDIDATE_IDS = ("0", "1", "2", "3")
```

Required query data:

```python
Query(
    title="Fitness over outer optimization iterations",
    x=("generation",),
    y=(
        ("by_mechanism", "0", "fitness"),
        ("by_mechanism", "1", "fitness"),
        ("by_mechanism", "2", "fitness"),
        ("by_mechanism", "3", "fitness"),
        ("fitness_mean",),
        ("fitness_best",),
    ),
)

Query(
    title="Global best fitness",
    x=("generation",),
    y=("best_fitness_global",),
)

Query(
    title="ES sigma",
    x=("generation",),
    y=("sigma",),
)
```

Exact visual parity:

- [ ] candidate fitness = marker traces;
- [ ] generation mean = line + markers;
- [ ] generation best = line + markers;
- [ ] candidate hover contains outer generation, candidate/mechanism index, and
      fitness;
- [ ] figure is cumulative over all completed generations.

This likely requires trace style metadata or a specialized plot query. Data
selection alone is not enough to reproduce marker-vs-line semantics.

---

## 5.3 ES search mean and global best

Required:

```python
Query(
    title="ES search mean",
    x=("generation",),
    y=(
        ("search_mean", "fixed_quota", "value"),
        ("search_mean", "restoration_subsidy", "value"),
    ),
)

Query(
    title="Global-best mechanism parameters",
    x=("generation",),
    y=(
        ("global_best", "fixed_quota", "value"),
        ("global_best", "restoration_subsidy", "value"),
    ),
)
```

After `generation_best` is added:

```python
Query(
    title="Generation-best mechanism parameters",
    x=("generation",),
    y=(
        ("generation_best", "fixed_quota", "value"),
        ("generation_best", "restoration_subsidy", "value"),
    ),
)
```

Parameter names are runtime-defined by `MechanismSpace`.

Target dynamic form:

```python
Query(
    title="ES search mean",
    x=("generation",),
    y=("search_mean", "*", "value"),
)

Query(
    title="Global-best mechanism parameters",
    x=("generation",),
    y=("global_best", "*", "value"),
)

Query(
    title="Generation-best mechanism parameters",
    x=("generation",),
    y=("generation_best", "*", "value"),
)
```

- [x] No optimized parameter name must be hard-coded after wildcard support.

---

## 5.4 ES fitness-vs-parameter scatter

Current concrete smoke-test generator:

```python
def es_parameter_fitness_queries(
    candidate_ids=("0", "1", "2", "3"),
    parameter_names=("fixed_quota", "restoration_subsidy"),
):
    queries = []

    for parameter_name in parameter_names:
        for candidate_id in candidate_ids:
            queries.append(
                Query(
                    title=f"Fitness vs {parameter_name} — candidate {candidate_id}",
                    x=(
                        "by_mechanism",
                        candidate_id,
                        "by_parameter",
                        parameter_name,
                        "value",
                    ),
                    y=(
                        "by_mechanism",
                        candidate_id,
                        "fitness",
                    ),
                )
            )

    return queries
```

This verifies that the data paths work, but it does **not** reproduce the dev
figure exactly.

Exact target:

```python
Query(
    title="Fitness vs fixed_quota",
    x=(
        "by_mechanism",
        "*",
        "by_parameter",
        "fixed_quota",
        "value",
    ),
    y=("by_mechanism", "*", "fitness"),
)
```

Required semantics:

- [x] all candidates in one cumulative scatter;
- [x] all generations included;
- [x] x/y wildcard bindings aligned by candidate ID;
- [x] each point carries generation metadata;
- [x] point color represents outer generation, as on dev;
- [x] colorbar title identifies outer iteration;
- [x] hover includes outer iteration, candidate/mechanism index, parameter
      value, and fitness;
- [x] one figure per runtime optimized parameter.

The current `Query` has no z/color metadata. Implement one of:

- [x] optional query metadata path for color/group (`Query.color`, resolved
      and aligned like `x`; `Series.color`; W&B marker colour, CSV `color`
      column, ignored by TensorBoard);
- [ ] `ScatterQuery`;
- [ ] generic named-dimension query consumed by the W&B reporter.

Do not bury generation lookup inside a W&B-only helper if the same semantic
plot should be portable to another backend.

---

## 5.5 ES parallel coordinates

Dev behavior:

- every evaluated candidate is one line;
- each optimized mechanism parameter is one axis;
- fitness is the final axis;
- fitness also controls line color;
- axis ranges are dynamically padded;
- all generations accumulate.

The current `Query(x, y)` API cannot represent this.

Implement one of:

### Option A

```python
ParallelCoordinatesQuery(
    title="Parallel coordinates of evaluated mechanisms",
    dimensions=(
        ("by_mechanism", "*", "by_parameter", "*", "value"),
        ("by_mechanism", "*", "fitness"),
    ),
    color=("by_mechanism", "*", "fitness"),
)
```

### Option B

A generic table/multidimensional query that resolves a row per evaluated
candidate and lets reporters choose a parallel-coordinate renderer.

Acceptance:

- [x] all optimized parameters appear exactly once (duplicate axis labels
      are rejected at resolution);
- [x] fitness appears exactly once as final axis;
- [x] line color = fitness;
- [x] rows remain aligned across parameter dimensions;
- [x] cumulative data across generations;
- [ ] fixed-mode ES still uses the full default mechanism vector (the payload
      does, `tests/optimizers/test_es_payload.py`; the parallel query in fixed
      mode is not exercised by a test);
- [x] empty/constant ranges do not crash.

---

# 6. P0 — schema extension rules must be documented and tested

## Add shared environment metric

Subclass `EpisodeRolloutSchema`:

```python
class FisheryMetricSchema(EpisodeRolloutSchema):
    new_env_metric: Optional[float] = Field(
        default=None,
        json_schema_extra={"reduce": ReduceProtocol.MEAN},
    )
```

## Add per-agent metric

Subclass `AgentEnvStepSchema` and override `by_agent`:

```python
class FisheryAgentMetricSchema(AgentEnvStepSchema):
    new_agent_metric: Optional[float] = Field(
        default=None,
        json_schema_extra={"reduce": ReduceProtocol.MEAN},
    )

class FisheryMetricSchema(EpisodeRolloutSchema):
    by_agent: dict[str, FisheryAgentMetricSchema] = Field(
        default_factory=dict
    )
```

## Add learner metric

Add to `PolicyLearnerSchema`.

## Add runtime policy dimension

Use:

```python
by_policy: dict[PolicyID, PolicyLearnerSchema]
```

Do not add one static field per policy.

## Add performance metric

Add to `PerformanceSchema`.

## Add ES generation metric

Add to `ESSchema`, generally as `SERIES` if the plot needs the full outer
history.

## Add ES candidate metric

Add to `ESCandidateSchema`.

## Add ES parameter metric

Add to `ESParameterSchema`.

## Add inner optimizer-specific schema under ES

Keep:

```python
inner: Optional[MetricSchema] = None
```

and rely on runtime subtype binding.

Tests must prove:

```text
ESSchema.inner declared MetricSchema
              runtime RaySchema
                     -> train/eval
                     -> by_mechanism
                     -> by_seed
                     -> by_episode runtime FisheryMetricSchema
                     -> by_agent runtime FisheryAgentMetricSchema
```

---

# 7. P1 — MetricLogger unit tests

Create focused unit tests, not only integration tests.

Suggested files:

```text
tests/metrics/test_metric_logger_schema_build.py
tests/metrics/test_metric_logger_push_data.py
tests/metrics/test_metric_logger_dynamic.py
tests/metrics/test_metric_logger_peek_reduce.py
```

Required tests:

## 7.1 Schema build

- [x] static nested `MetricSchema` builds the correct node tree;
- [x] `dict[ID, MetricSchema]` becomes a dynamic node;
- [x] leaf reducer metadata creates the correct Metric subclass;
- [x] `_refs` contains every materialized leaf path.

## 7.2 Push leaf values

- [x] push scalar into existing leaf;
- [x] skip `None`;
- [x] reject unknown field;
- [x] reject incompatible value/schema.

## 7.3 Dynamic dict materialization

- [x] first dynamic ID materializes its subtree;
- [x] second dynamic ID materializes independently;
- [x] runtime subclass of declared schema is accepted;
- [x] unrelated schema is rejected;
- [x] runtime schema cannot silently change for an already-bound ID.

## 7.4 Static nested runtime subtype binding

This is the ES inner-optimizer regression test.

- [x] `ESSchema.inner` starts declared as `MetricSchema`;
- [x] first `RaySchema` push replaces/materializes the inner subtree;
- [ ] `train` and `eval` fields exist;
- [x] second `RaySchema` push reuses the same subtree;
- [x] second push accumulates metrics instead of resetting to length 1;
- [ ] switching to an incompatible concrete subtype in the same logger raises.

## 7.5 Deep runtime polymorphism

Push:

```text
ESSchema
 -> inner RaySchema
 -> train rollout
 -> by_mechanism["0"]
 -> by_seed["seed"]
 -> by_episode["episode"]
 -> FisheryMetricSchema
 -> by_agent["utilizer:0"]
 -> FisheryAgentMetricSchema
```

Assert deep fields such as:

```text
fish_norm
quota_stress
requested_harvest
quota_penalty
```

are registered and receive values.

## 7.6 `peek()`

- [x] non-destructive;
- [x] two consecutive peeks are equal;
- [x] SERIES history remains intact;
- [x] calling reporter after peek does not change logger contents.

## 7.7 `reduce()`

- [x] destructive according to current Metric semantics;
- [x] resulting typed schema is correct;
- [x] empty reducer semantics are correct:
      Series `[]`, Mean `None`, Min `None`, Max `None`, Last `None`,
      Sum `0`, Count `0`.

## 7.8 `_refs`

- [x] `_refs[path]` is the same leaf object as the corresponding `_tree` leaf;
- [x] dynamic materialization updates `_refs`;
- [ ] reduction does not leave stale aliases.

# 8. P1 — Query unit tests

Suggested files:

```text
tests/reporting/test_query.py
tests/reporting/test_query_resolution.py
tests/reporting/test_query_wildcards.py
```

## 8.1 Constructor / validation

- [x] one-element path tuple is supported;
- [x] one y path;
- [x] multiple y paths;
- [x] `error="std"` with `reduce="none"` raises;
- [x] malformed empty path raises or has documented behavior.

## 8.2 Static resolution

- [x] root leaf;
- [x] nested leaf;
- [ ] multiple y paths;
- [x] x/y length mismatch produces a clear error.

## 8.3 Mean/std

Synthetic series:

```python
seed_1 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
seed_2 = [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
```

Expected:

```python
mean = [2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
std = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
```

Assert exact output before testing W&B rendering.

## 8.4 Wildcards

- [x] one wildcard;
- [x] two nested wildcards;
- [x] concrete key + wildcard;
- [x] deterministic match order;
- [x] no matches;
- [x] wildcard only applies to dynamic dict nodes.

## 8.5 Wildcard grouping

For:

```text
mechanism -> seed -> value
```

assert:

- [x] one group per mechanism;
- [x] reduction across seeds only;
- [x] mechanism groups do not get averaged together.

## 8.6 Wildcard x/y alignment

Synthetic candidate data:

```text
m0 parameter=0.1 fitness=10
m1 parameter=0.2 fitness=20
m2 parameter=0.3 fitness=30
```

Resolved scatter rows must be:

```text
(0.1, 10)
(0.2, 20)
(0.3, 30)
```

Never:

```text
(0.1, 20)
...
```

---

# 9. P1 — Reporter base tests

Suggested:

```text
tests/reporting/test_reporter_base.py
```

- [x] Reporter resolves every registered query against the configured schema.
- [x] Empty query list is a no-op.
- [x] Missing path includes the full path in the error.
- [x] Multiple y series preserve labels/identity.
- [x] Reduced mean/std data has expected shape.
- [x] Wildcard metadata/bindings survive until backend `_report`.
- [x] Reporter does not mutate input `MetricSchema`.
- [ ] Same accumulated SERIES may be reported repeatedly as it grows.

---

# 10. P1 — W&B reporter tests

Use mocks/fakes; unit tests should not require a network connection.

Suggested:

```text
tests/reporting/test_wandb_reporter.py
```

Required:

- [x] simple line query logs under stable key;
- [x] multiple raw y series produce expected trace count;
- [x] mean/std creates mean + band;
- [x] dynamic wildcard trace labels contain mechanism/seed/policy/agent ID;
- [ ] repeated report with growing SERIES updates using the complete current
      history;
- [ ] ES fitness plot trace count and types match dev;
- [ ] ES parameter scatter point count =
      generations × population size;
- [ ] ES scatter x/y candidate correspondence is exact;
- [ ] parallel coordinates dimensions are exact;
- [ ] constant fitness/parameter values do not crash range calculation;
- [ ] no global W&B history table is required as source of truth.

For dev parity, assert figure structure where practical:

```text
trace names
trace count
trace mode
x arrays
y arrays
band upper/lower
hover metadata fields
```

A screenshot comparison can be a secondary integration check, but numeric
trace assertions should be primary.

---

# 11. P1 — environment integration tests

Suggested:

```text
tests/integration/test_fishery_visualization.py
```

Small deterministic fixture:

```text
2 mechanisms
2 seeds
2 agents
short horizon
few training iterations
```

- [ ] environment logger contains expected horizon length;
- [ ] `FisheryMetricSchema` values match direct env values;
- [ ] `by_agent` contains both agents;
- [ ] horizon reporter receives data before episode reduction;
- [ ] reduction afterward still works.

---

# 12. P1 — Ray/inner optimizer integration tests

Use a short deterministic run or a synthetic adaptor payload when full RLlib
would be too expensive.

- [ ] `RaySchema.train` populated;
- [ ] `RaySchema.eval` populated after explicit evaluation;
- [ ] all mechanism IDs present;
- [ ] all seed IDs present;
- [ ] stable episode IDs present;
- [ ] per-policy learner IDs present;
- [ ] performance fields present;
- [ ] train/eval query outputs match manually computed values;
- [ ] mechanism mean/std across seeds matches NumPy calculation.

---

# 13. P1 — ES integration tests

Use a deterministic synthetic environment if possible.

Fixture:

```text
population size = 4
dimension = 2
3 generations
parameter names = fixed_quota, restoration_subsidy
```

- [ ] one ES payload per generation;
- [ ] generation series length grows 1 -> 2 -> 3;
- [ ] candidate fitness series length grows 1 -> 2 -> 3;
- [ ] search mean series grows;
- [ ] global best is updated after current population evaluation;
- [ ] logged mean/sigma correspond to the pre-update distribution that sampled
      the population;
- [ ] `inner` contains the concrete inner schema;
- [ ] second generation does not reconstruct/reset `inner`;
- [ ] fitness plot has `3 * 4 = 12` candidate points;
- [ ] each parameter scatter has 12 points;
- [ ] parallel coordinates has 12 lines;
- [ ] global-best trajectory is monotonic non-decreasing for maximization.

Fixed-mode regression:

- [ ] ES dimension 0 does not crash reporting;
- [ ] plotting payload uses the full default mechanism vector;
- [ ] parameter names match the default mechanism vector.

---

# 14. P1 — CSV reporter implementation

CSV export is part of the feature definition and must be completed.

Suggested file:

```text
core/reporting/csv.py
```

The CSV reporter must consume the same `Query` contract.

## 14.1 Required behavior

- [x] implement Reporter subclass;
- [x] configure output directory/path through `ReporterConfig`;
- [x] create directories safely;
- [x] stable file naming from query title/key;
- [x] append/update semantics documented;
- [x] no W&B dependency;
- [x] scalar series export;
- [x] multiple raw series export;
- [x] mean/std export;
- [x] dynamic wildcard labels exported;
- [ ] train/eval/mechanism/seed dimensions preserved as columns;
- [ ] ES candidate/parameter metadata preserved;
- [ ] flush/close lifecycle;
- [ ] safe behavior if process exits after partial run.

Recommended long-form representation:

```text
query
x
series
value
error_std
phase
mechanism
seed
episode
policy
agent
parameter
generation
```

Only populate dimensions relevant to the query.

For simple queries, a wide CSV may also be convenient:

```text
iter, reward_mean, reward_min, reward_max
```

Do not throw away dynamic identity just to force everything into wide format.

## 14.2 CSV tests

- [x] temp directory fixture;
- [x] single series;
- [x] multi-series;
- [ ] mean/std;
- [x] wildcard series labels;
- [x] repeated report appends/updates correctly;
- [x] no duplicate header;
- [ ] NaN/None policy documented;
- [x] output can be loaded by pandas and reconstruct expected series.

# 15. P1 — TensorBoard reporter implementation

TensorBoard support must be completed.

Suggested file:

```text
core/reporting/tensorboard.py
```

Use the same resolved Query result, not raw optimizer dictionaries.

## 15.1 Required behavior

- [x] Reporter subclass;
- [x] `SummaryWriter` lifecycle;
- [x] stable tag naming;
- [x] single scalar/series using `add_scalar`;
- [ ] multiple related series using `add_scalars` where appropriate;
- [x] dynamic mechanism/policy/agent labels represented in tags;
- [x] mean/std behavior documented;
- [ ] train/eval grouping represented consistently;
- [x] flush and close;
- [x] no W&B imports.

Complex figures:

- line/scatter/shaded plots can be logged either as:
  - scalar families that TensorBoard renders natively; or
  - a rendered figure/image where native scalar APIs are insufficient.
- parallel coordinates likely requires image/figure rendering because
  TensorBoard does not have a native parallel-coordinate primitive.

- [ ] choose and document the complex-figure representation;
- [ ] avoid adding a heavy conversion dependency unless justified.

## 15.2 TensorBoard tests

- [x] temporary logdir;
- [x] event file created;
- [x] expected scalar tags exist;
- [ ] repeated iterations produce multiple steps;
- [ ] dynamic tags are stable;
- [x] writer flush/close works;
- [ ] complex figure path has a test if supported.

# 16. P2 — exact dev environment tables / post-hoc analysis

The old dev environment module also emitted:

- raw long-form timestep table;
- raw wide timestep table;
- derived wide table;
- correlation matrix;
- distribution summary;
- training metrics table.

Decide whether these belong in the generic visualization API or in CSV/post-hoc
analysis.

- [ ] Do not silently drop them if they are still required.
- [ ] Prefer CSV/table export over forcing them into line `Query`.
- [ ] Keep generic reporting backend-agnostic.
- [ ] Water-specific observed-vs-simulated plots should remain domain-specific
      unless generalized deliberately.

# 17. P2 — clean up legacy dev plotting only after parity

Legacy modules currently hold W&B-specific history/state such as accumulated
tables.

Once the feature branch passes parity tests:

- [ ] remove obsolete direct W&B calls from optimizers;
- [ ] remove duplicate ES history caches;
- [ ] remove dead `plot_population`, `plot_parameter_names`, `plot_mean`, and
      `plot_best_candidate` preparation if no longer used;
- [ ] remove old plotting entry points only after screenshots/data are compared;
- [ ] leave migration notes or deprecation stubs if other examples import them.

Do not delete dev reference code before the parity test is complete.

# 18. P2 — optional-schema presence semantics

Current schema design has optional nested branches such as:

```python
class RaySchema(MetricSchema):
    train: Optional[TrainSchema] = None
    eval: Optional[EvalSchema] = None
```

Verify that an absent optional branch remains `None` instead of being
constructed as an empty schema during `peek()`/`reduce()`.

Do not infer absence from leaf reduced values because legitimate empty reducer
values include:

```text
Sum   -> 0
Count -> 0
Series -> []
```

If needed, add explicit node presence tracking.

- [ ] test train-only payload;
- [ ] test eval-only payload;
- [ ] test train + eval payload;
- [ ] test destructive reduce/reset behavior.

# 19. P2 — Ray serialization boundary regression

The optimizer-local `MetricLogger` should not have to cross into the `World`
actor merely to register an optimizer ID.

- [ ] base optimizer config sends only optimizer ID/registry data to World;
- [ ] Ray optimizer config follows the same ownership model;
- [ ] regression test proves an optimizer containing an unpicklable local
      object can still register if only its ID crosses the actor boundary.

This keeps logger/reporter runtime state local to the optimizer that owns it.

# 21. Final acceptance run

Use one small deterministic fishery configuration and preserve its config/seed
in the test documentation.

Recommended:

```text
4 ES candidates
2 optimized parameters:
    fixed_quota
    restoration_subsidy
2-3 environment seeds
>= 3 outer generations
short horizon for CI
explicit evaluation
```

Capture both dev and feature outputs.

Compare:

## Environment

- [ ] same horizon x values;
- [ ] same fish biomass;
- [ ] same harvest;
- [ ] same quota stress;
- [ ] same agent reward/action/harvest/penalty values.

## Inner optimizer

- [ ] same rollout aggregates;
- [ ] same performance values;
- [ ] same per-policy learner values;
- [ ] same mechanism × seed values;
- [ ] same train/eval grouping;
- [ ] same mean/std calculation.

## ES

- [ ] same candidate-to-fitness correspondence;
- [ ] same generation mean/best;
- [ ] same global best;
- [ ] same search mean/sigma semantics;
- [ ] same parameter scatter point set;
- [ ] same parallel-coordinate row set.

Plot styling can differ only where intentionally documented. The goal for this
branch request is to reproduce the dev plots exactly unless a difference is
explicitly approved.

# 22. Feature status summary

Already supported / expected to work now:

- [x] Environment horizon plots.
- [x] Raw RLlib rollout plots.
- [x] Performance plots.
- [x] Per-policy learner data/plots with concrete IDs.
- [x] Per-agent environment data/plots with concrete IDs.
- [x] ES SERIES accumulation through `push_data -> peek -> report`.
- [x] Nested ES `inner: MetricSchema` runtime specialization to `RaySchema`.
- [x] Deep runtime specialization to fishery episode and agent schemas.

Shipped since this section was written (reconciled on 2026-09-01 against
commit 080d43c; the status block at the top of this file and the
"feature/logging-testing" section of `docs/MERGE_NOTES.md` hold the details):

- [x] Dynamic mechanism, seed, policy and agent IDs: `"*"` wildcards in
  `Query` paths, resolved by the base `Reporter`.
- [x] Dynamic ES parameter keys: the parameter dicts are keyed by
  `ParameterName`, and `es_parameter_fitness_queries(parameter_names)` builds
  one scatter per optimized parameter.
- [x] Mechanism mean ±std across seeds through the Query API:
  `reduce="mean", error="std"` groups on the first wildcard (option B of §3.1,
  no schema change).
- [x] ES all-candidate parameter scatter in one plot (`Fitness vs <parameter>`,
  one series per population slot).
- [x] ES generation color metadata: `Query.color`, rendered as marker colour on
  W&B and as the `color` column of the CSV files (§5.4).
- [x] ES parallel coordinates: `ParallelCoordinatesQuery` (§5.5).
- [x] Generation-best ES parameter schema and queries: `ESSchema.generation_best`
  and `Generation-best mechanism parameters`.
- [x] Full unit tests: 530 unit tests, 99 % coverage of `core/` without a Ray
  runtime.
- [x] CSV reporter (`core/reporting/csv.py`, one long-form file per query).
- [x] TensorBoard reporter (`core/reporting/tensor_board.py`, scalars only;
  parallel coordinates are skipped with a warning).
- [x] Legacy visualization cleanup: `core/reporting/utils/` and
  `examples/bilevel_fishery/deprecated/` are deleted (the empty `deprecated/`
  directory that may remain on disk is untracked).

Still open:

- [ ] Dynamic episode IDs: episode-level wildcard queries over `by_episode`
  need an episode-to-iteration key (§3–§4, decision pending with Nadine).
- [ ] Train-vs-eval shaded mechanism plots through the Query API: not built;
  the train and eval environments report into separate owners.
- [ ] ES exact candidate/mean/best mixed trace styling: `Fitness over
  generations` carries the mean, generation-best and global-best lines, but
  the trace styles were not compared against the `dev` figures.
- [ ] Full integration parity tests: `tests/integration/` covers the fishery
  reporting path end-to-end but does not compare figures with `dev`.
