"""Core library of the bilevel fishery framework.

The package is organised by level of the bilevel loop. ``core.world`` holds
the shared blackboard both levels talk to, ``core.mechanism`` defines the
regulatory mechanisms the outer level optimizes, ``core.envs`` contains the
environments (the outer ``RegulatorEnv`` and the inner mechanism-regulated
multi-agent benchmarks), ``core.reporting`` streams figures to Weights &
Biases, and ``core.adaptors`` binds everything to Ray RLlib. The top-level
modules ``types``, ``utils``, ``annotations`` and ``callbacks`` are shared
helpers. This ``__init__`` re-exports nothing; import from the submodules
directly.
