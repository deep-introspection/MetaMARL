"""Geometry of the mechanism manifold.

``MechanismSpace`` is the protocol a benchmark implements to connect its
semantic :class:`~core.mechanism.base.Mechanism` to the outer optimizer:
``encode`` and ``decode`` map between a mechanism and a normalized vector of
fixed ``dimension``, ``clip`` enforces the parameter ranges, ``sample`` draws a
random mechanism and ``default`` provides the one in force before any candidate
is published. Environments receive a space (class or instance) through the
``mechanism_space`` argument of :class:`core.envs.base.BaseEnv`.
