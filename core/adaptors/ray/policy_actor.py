"""Ray actor that owns the RLlib ``Algorithm`` of the inner optimizer.

``RayOptimizer`` never holds an ``Algorithm`` itself; it drives this actor
through ``.remote()`` calls. Building the algorithm inside the actor keeps the
learner, its env runners and their evaluation counterparts in one process tree
and lets the outer loop rebuild the policy between ES generations without
touching the driver.
